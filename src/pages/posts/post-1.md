# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2024-09-27

Welcome to my blog. I am learning to construct static sites using the Astro framework. 

## What I've done so far:

1. **Install Astro**: Create a working install using Node.js and VS Code. Push code to github and publish using Netlify.

2. **Making Pages**: Learn how to construct pages and link them together.

3. **Create this blog**: This is it!

## What's Next

Continue to learn Astro.
